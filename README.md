# uber_data_analytics_dataeng
Uber data analytics is a data engineering project that consists of various analyses performed on the Uber data using pandas to find different relationships and dividing the dataset into different dimensional tables and one fact table containing the different dimensional table primary keys and other numeral columns that did not fit in any dimensional tables.
Mage.AI is employed in the development of the pipeline, which includes the data loader, data transformation, and data exporter. 
The pipeline's final step is to transmit allÂ the created tables to a SQL database for various queries on the tables.  The final dataset is used for visualization, therefore a Tableau dashboard is built.
